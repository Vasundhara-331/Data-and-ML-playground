# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a classic machine learning task: predicting survival of Titanic passengers based on their features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.

This project demonstrates **machine learning training** in Python using real-world data.
