## Python Mini Projects: From Logic to ML

Welcome to my Python Mini Projects repository! This collection demonstrates my journey from basic Python logic to data analysis and machine learning. Each project is self-contained and organized in its own folder with a README explaining its purpose and usage.

## Projects Included

| Project | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Random Story Generator | Logic | Generates fun, random stories using Python's built-in features. No ML involved. |
| Student Marks Analysis | Data Analysis | Performs calculations and visualizations on student grades and performance. |
| Titanic Survival Prediction | Machine Learning | Classic ML project predicting Titanic passenger survival using features like age, gender, and class. |

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
git clone <https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git>

2. Navigate to the project folder of your choice.

3. Run the code in Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab(what I used for this project).
